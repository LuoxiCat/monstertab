The first time I write a project, don't spray;
I used a lot of browser start pages and found them to be very bloated, so I decided to write one in HTML myself
I'm kind of learning and writing (my main languages are C++ and Python, and Java and Dart are learning)
I'm only 15 years old, I'm in high school, and updates will be slow
